# Obsidian-Excalidraw-ymjr

This is a modified version of the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin).

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

Based on my specific needs, I made necessary modifications to the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) when custom scripts couldn't fulfill those requirements.

## Features
Here are the functionalities that required modifications in order to be implemented.

When combined with custom scripts, it allows for:

- Support for multiple custom fonts simultaneously
- Obsidian tag functionality for elements

  - Show/hide elements
  - Expand/collapse mind map
  - Adjust row/column height/width in tables
  - Zoom in/out or mouse scroll to show/hide elements
- Keyboard event hooks
  - Add elements to mind maps
  - Play GIF frame by frame
  - Show/hide individual elements in the current view
- Bold text
- Indentation of the first line of text in containers
- Gradient for shapes and text
- Shadow for shapes and text
- Layer functionality
- Fix for wrapping issues with Chinese characters
- Dragging point hook
  - Measurement feature
- Display canvas thumbnail
- Mouse hover hook
  - Change shadow on mouse hover (callout, buttons)
- Uniform formula size to match font size
- Reference and navigation to specific parts of an excalidraw canvas
