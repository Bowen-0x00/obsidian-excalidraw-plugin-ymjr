# Obsidian-Excalidraw-ymjr

This is a modified version of the [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin).

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

Based on my specific needs, I made necessary modifications to the obsidian-excalidraw-plugin when custom scripts couldn't fulfill those requirements.

You can find the custom scripts at [obsidian-excalidraw-scripts](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-scripts) (Uploading...)
